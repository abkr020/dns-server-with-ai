# dns server toy

## aobut the project
crearted a dns server and added the ai with it to answer small questions

very very basic dns server
created a dns server with denamed and added an ai and instead of returning the ip address i made it to return the answer of the question requested by the user 

you can request like this on the terminal 

```
dig TXT @<ip address of my dns server> -p <port of my dns server> <you question in the format like what.is.a.protocol>

```

you can ask any small question because dns request just wait for 3 seconds and if ai takes tools more than that to get your answer form google ai so the the query form your terminal will not accept the response>

excited to host it and add more features to it
